# node-project

This project is based on the natours project from the following Jonas udemy course:
https://www.udemy.com/course/nodejs-express-mongodb-bootcamp/

I have already completed this course, but as a refresher, I am going to code along the entire series to

For anyone interested in this Udemy course, I can't recommend it enough. You will learn a ton of core concepts.
However, I strongly encourage any aspiring node developers to check out this course first before beginning the course
listed above:
